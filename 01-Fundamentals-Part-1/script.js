/*
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula:
 BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height). (mass in kg and height in meter).

1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both versions)
3. Create a boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.

TEST DATA 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.
TEST DATA 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall.

Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and improve it:

1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. 
The message can be either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs.
 Example: "Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"

HINT: Use an if/else statement ðŸ˜‰

//Type conversion and Type coercion

// type conversion

console.log(Number(inputYear),inputYear);// Number()function will convert string into a number ie., numbers which are written into string eg:'12'//

console.log(Number('sree')); //number()function will not convert the string(here it is 'sree') into number. it gives error called Nan- not anumber//
console.log(typeof Nan);

//type coercion

console.log('I am '+ 23 +' year old'); // 23 is converted into number automatically using coercion//
console.log('I am '+String(23)+ 'year old');// converting the number 23 into string manually using the String() function//
console.log('23'/2); // it supports subtraction,division, multiplication, greaterand so on. it will convert string to number and number to string when ever it wants.//

console.log('23'>24);
console.log('2'+'3'+2);

console.log(2+3+4+'5');// 95 : numbers are added and then string is added ie., 2+3+4=9 and 5 is added =95


//  falsy values: 0,null ,undefined,Nan,'' (emptystring)
// falsy values will becomefalse when we try to convert into a boolean.

console.log(Boolean(0));
console.log(Boolean(undefined));

//the conversion to boolean is always done  implicit or  we can say typed coercion that javascript does automatically behind the scenes.//
//javascript do typecoercion to booleans in 2 scenarios1) using logical operators//
//2)logical context for eg in the condition of if-else statement//

const money=0;

                // is trying to change the 0 to boolean valuein the ifstatment. 0 is a falsy value so it is executing the else part// 
if (height){                    // we can fix this problem using logical operator//
